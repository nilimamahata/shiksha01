# TODO List for Shiksha3 Project

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Add logout button to student dashboard sidebar: Implemented in StudentDashboard.js with CSS scrolling fix in StudentDashboard.css to ensure visibility. The button is positioned at the bottom of the sidebar, styled appropriately, and handles logout by clearing localStorage and redirecting to /login. Added overflow-y: auto to .sidebar-nav for scrolling when nav links exceed viewport height.

## Pending Tasks
- Integrate backend logout endpoint for session invalidation (optional enhancement).
- Test responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility for the sidebar scrolling.
- Add confirmation dialog to logout button if desired.

Last updated: After adding logout button visibility fix.
